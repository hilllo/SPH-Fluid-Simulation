SPH-Fluid-Simulation
===
CMU 15-662 16Spring Final Project

Xiaoshan Lu (xiaoshal) and Sarvesh Subramanian (sarveshs)

Proposal
---
####Option F: SPH Fluid Simulation
1. We'll code from scratch.
2. We'll render the fluid using OpenGL.
3. ~~We'll implement a 2D fluid simulation first.~~ (We didn't do this at last but to implement step 4 directly)
4. If we have time, we'll implement a 3D fluid simulation as well.
5. We'll use Matching Cube algorithm to create the surface of the fluid.
